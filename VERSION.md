## Cache Busting

To force browsers to load new versions:
1. Update version in index.html manually, OR
2. Run: `node update-version.js [version] [description]`

Example:
```bash
node update-version.js 1.5.1 "Fixed modal display issue"
```

This will update:
- Version comment in index.html
- Query parameters on script/style tags
- Force browser cache refresh
